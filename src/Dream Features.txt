Dream Features
Low effort (probably implemented)
- Add hit/miss message (optional)
- Add something like goblin boss, elite goblin or demon that rewards 1000 points when killed (30 hits to kill with button mash)
- Add goblin death animation (flying with blue background)
- Add walls which can be destroyed with button mash

Medium effort
- Add milestones to increase difficulty (100, 200, and so on)
- Multiple goblins in one row (only on higher difficulty)
- More goblin columns

Unknown effort
- Food to replenish lives
- Add music
- Goblins are actually fighting back when the player missed (make it something like a counterattack animation)
- Dynamic direction: from east, south, and west
- Add hurt voice (both Succubus & Goblins)
- Goblins are scrolling smoothly from top to bottom like Piano Tiles
- Timed reaction (3 second delay until the goblin hits back)
- Explosive barrel/cacti (basically obstacles that reduce lives) (optional because just missing already reduces lives)

- Also scroll the soil if possible
- More soil variants: evil biome (mostly red & purple), good biome (mostly blue)
- Hostages/kidnapped prisoners to rescue
- Upgrades: weapon, lives & stronger goblins
- Settlement view: to upgrade weapon & lives
- Berserk mode: mash keyboard keys for 10 seconds to get the most goblins (also include its own N hits in a row system)
- Duel mode: Every player is given the same set of goblins and they have to beat the most goblins in 1 minute
- 1 minute mode: kill as many goblins in 1 minute
- Story mode: make the story emotional (sad and happy)
- Fake achievements: incremental achievement system with constant prizes
- Idle game system: give players prize when they come back to the game within a specified timeframe
